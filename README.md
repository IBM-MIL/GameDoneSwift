# GameDoneSwift
##Brand New Project
Welcome to your brand new project! 

This is what an empty SpriteKit template looks like. Getting your project to look like this is fairly simple. 
It just takes a few mouse clicks. You really don't even need to clone this branch if you want to make the 
empty project yourself. We just have it here for convenience.
