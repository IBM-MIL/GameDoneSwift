# GameDoneSwift

Welcome to *GameDoneSwift*! Our first project tutorial on github!

## How This Works

All the branches in this repo are set up as different sections of a tutorial series with the final
product of creating a basic game in swift. The branches are as follows:

1. [Brand-New-Project](https://github.com/IBM-MIL/GameDoneSwift/tree/Brand-New-Project)
    - Where to go if you want to start the whole journey from the beginning.
2. [Reticulating-Splines](https://github.com/IBM-MIL/GameDoneSwift/tree/Reticulating-Splines)
    - Details how to setup and link the game scene.
3. [Lets-Get-Physical](https://github.com/IBM-MIL/GameDoneSwift/tree/Lets-Get-Physical)
    - Setting up the physics of the game.
4. [As-The-World-Turns](https://github.com/IBM-MIL/GameDoneSwift/tree/As-The-World-Turns)
    - Generating random infinite content.
5. [Game-Over](https://github.com/IBM-MIL/GameDoneSwift/tree/Game-Over)
    - Adding final touches like music and reset.
    
This branch (master) contains the full completed game.

## What To Expect

A simple introduction on how to use SpriteKit and Swift. Some basic Swift features such as `guard`
statements and `do-try-catch` blocks will be used throughout the tutorial. You'll also learn
the basics of the SpriteKit physics engine and how to add physics bodies to your sprites. The 
SpriteKit scene editor will be used, and instructions on how to set up a game scene using it will
be detailed. We'll also give a very basic explanation on how game scenes work. 

## What Not To Expect

In general the code was written to be easy to follow, so a lot of higher level functionality available
in Swift, iOS, and even SpriteKit won't be used. This also means that all code won't be optimized or
written as modualar as possible (seriously, `GameScene.swift` gets pretty large by the end).
Functions are seperated out in a logical way, but not necessarily the way they would be for a
release candidate project. It is also assumed that you know how to use git. We don't plan on teaching
how to navigate branches. If any of this bothers you, this probably isn't the tutorial you're
looking for. 

However, if all you want is a quick and dirty dive into SpriteKit then welcome aboard! You can start 
the tutorial over in the [Brand-New-Project](https://github.com/IBM-MIL/GameDoneSwift/tree/Brand-New-Project)
branch.

## Time To Complete

Depending on how serious you take the tutorial, it should only take ~1 hour from start to finish.
